", "body"=>"In October 2014, Kesha filed a lawsuit against producer Dr. Luke, accusing him of sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, and emotional distress, among other allegations. For over a year, Luke remained publicly silent about the suit, letting his legal team serve as his mouthpiece, while filing his own countersuit alleging extortion. All silence ceremoniously broke on February 21, when a judge denied Kesha’s request to be released from her contract under Luke’s Sony label Kemosabe. By then, the #FreeKesha fan army had already assembled. It was only after major artists like Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson voiced support for Kesha on Twitter—and after Luke’s lawyers claimed a “trial by Twitter”—that Luke felt compelled to use the platform to profess his innocence.\r\n\r\nThe day after the ruling, Luke wrote in one tweet, among other denials: “I didn’t rape Kesha and I have never had sex with her. Kesha and I were friends for many years and she was like my little sister.” What’s surprising, other than his decision to take the stand via Twitter, is that the tweets have yet to be deleted.\r\n\r\nDiscussing an ongoing legal case in public violates a traditional, unofficial rule of celebrity litigation (as well as litigation in general): never speak. And, on a basic level, posting on social media about a highly sensitive and ongoing entanglement—legal or not—violates a newer common-sense dictum: never tweet. “No comment” is typically the rule of thumb. But for Luke and other celebs, public opinion can grow so thick that it topples the need to stay tongue-tied.\r\n\r\nIn Luke’s case specifically, which involves allegations of fairly horrific sexual abuse, it’s tough to care too deeply about whether or not these tweets might hurt his case. What’s interesting, however, is how this question will play out in the future: how social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) has changed the legal game—both for the stars whose posts are guaranteed to draw attention, and their attorneys, who are paid to keep them out of trouble. Is the illusion of risk greater than the reality? How does a legal team control potentially boneheaded famous clients and avoid defamatory social media use?\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the lawyers I spoke to about Luke’s and other prominent celebrity cases say they advise clients to stay away from social media altogether. “My hard rule would be not to say anything about any disputes that you’re involved in, in any kind of media,” says entertainment and sports lawyer Lisa E. Davis, who represents author Terry McMillan and has served as legal counsel on films like the documentary 9/11 and Malcolm X. “With social media, the rules are no different than they used to be for newspapers. The difference, of course, is that it’s not mediated by any editors, and even though you can quote-unquote delete it, you really can’t get rid of it.”\r\n\r\nEven as famous people operate within the same legal system as normal people, the celebrity is clearly extra liable—in several different ways. In some cases, defamatory tweets or posts lead to lawsuits. While we might be able to get away with extremely rude tweets about exes or colleagues, Courtney Love got sued for it twice. In other situations, social posts, quickly amplified and preserved in a thousand screenshots, can damage already pending cases, as with 50 Cent’s bankruptcy case this year. Complications arise when celebs focus more on building relatable personas and keeping the public on their side at all times than on solving or avoiding legal trouble.
